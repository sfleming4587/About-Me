    <!-- Project Title -->
    <h1 class="project-title">Software Optimization for a 16-bit DAC</h1>

    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <div class="project-description">
        As part of a year-long senior design project sponsored by <span class="highlight">Fieldline Medical</span>, I served as the <span class="highlight">Software Lead</span> on a team tasked with designing a 16-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) from scratch. With no prior experience, I self-taught <span class="highlight">SystemVerilog</span>, FPGA development, and Quartus Prime in a short timeframe, delivering a high-performance solution under tight constraints. Below are key highlights of my contributions, showcasing my skills in optimization, signal processing, and hardware-software integration.
    </div>

    <!-- Oversampling Pipeline Section -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Oversampling Pipeline</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        One of my primary responsibilities was designing an oversampler to transition signals from a 250 kHz input to a 16 MHz binary output, a critical step for the DAC’s performance. I developed the <span class="highlight">oversampling_pipeline.sv</span> module to handle this clock domain crossing efficiently. Initially, the 16-bit multiplication and division operations caused resource bottlenecks. To address this, I implemented a <span class="highlight">pipelining strategy</span>, delaying the response by one clock cycle but significantly reducing resource usage. This optimization improved the DAC’s throughput and demonstrated my ability to balance trade-offs in real-time systems.

    <!-- Delta Sigma Modulation Section -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Delta Sigma Modulation</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        Another key contribution was implementing <span class="highlight">Delta Sigma Modulation</span> in the <span class="highlight">delta_sigma_single.sv</span> file. This module converted a 16-bit digital input into a high-frequency pulse density output of 1s and 0s, achieving an analog output (Thanks to our hardware team!) with precision down to 1/(2^16) between -3.3 and 3.3 volts. Mastering this complex signal processing technique required deep dives into modulation theory and SystemVerilog, showcasing my ability to learn and apply advanced concepts to meet stringent accuracy requirements.

        Note: Due to an NDA with Fieldline Medical, I cannot share the source code. However, I’m happy to discuss my approach and technical decisions in detail during an interview!

    <h2 class="project-title">Game Development: Mastering Unity and C# through Expert Guidance</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        This project represents a deliberate deep dive into game development, guided by the expertise of <span class="highlight">Code Monkey</span>, a renowned coder whose comprehensive Unity tutorial I followed. Rather than aiming for originality, my goal was to absorb professional techniques and workflows from an industry expert, building a strong foundation in <span class="highlight">Unity</span> and <span class="highlight">C#</span>. The result, Kitchen Chaos, is a testament to my ability to rapidly learn and implement complex systems—skills directly applicable to a software development career. Below are the key technical proficiencies I gained, with a focus on clean, scalable code and modern development practices.
    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        Starting with the basics, I mastered Unity’s core architecture—scene management, components, and prefabs—alongside foundational C# programming. I implemented a <span class="highlight">character controller</span> from scratch, ensuring smooth player movement and interaction with the game world. To handle object detection and collision, I utilized <span class="highlight">physics raycasts</span>, enabling precise identification of objects and robust collision handling. This experience honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of 3D spatial logic, a valuable asset for software optimization tasks.
    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        A major focus was writing <span class="highlight">clean, scalable code</span>. I leveraged <span class="highlight">C# interfaces</span> and <span class="highlight">events</span> to create modular, reusable systems, decoupling game logic from visuals for better maintainability. For example, I separated UI functionality from core mechanics, ensuring flexibility for future updates. I also embraced <span class="highlight">Scriptable Objects</span> to manage data efficiently, reducing runtime overhead and enhancing scalability—an approach that mirrors best practices in professional software engineering. Regular <span class="highlight">refactoring</span> kept my codebase organized and adaptable, reflecting my commitment to quality.
    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        I explored cutting-edge Unity features, including the <span class="highlight">new input system</span>, which I used to create responsive, platform-agnostic controls. Visual enhancements came through <span class="highlight">Shader Graph</span> for custom effects and <span class="highlight">object animations</span> via Animator state machines, blending technical precision with creative execution. These skills demonstrate my ability to balance functionality and aesthetics—a critical duality in software development. Completing Kitchen Chaos and deploying it via WebGL underscored my capacity to deliver end-to-end solutions, from concept to production-ready application.
