    <!-- Project Title -->
    <h1 class="project-title">Software Optimization for a 16-bit DAC</h1>

    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <div class="project-description">
        As part of a year-long senior design project sponsored by <span class="highlight">Fieldline Medical</span>, I served as the <span class="highlight">Software Lead</span> on a team tasked with designing a 16-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) from scratch. With no prior experience, I self-taught <span class="highlight">SystemVerilog</span>, FPGA development, and Quartus Prime in a short timeframe, delivering a high-performance solution under tight constraints. Below are key highlights of my contributions, showcasing my skills in optimization, signal processing, and hardware-software integration.

    <!-- Oversampling Pipeline Section -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Oversampling Pipeline</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        One of my primary responsibilities was designing an oversampler to transition signals from a 250 kHz input to a 16 MHz binary output, a critical step for the DAC’s performance. I developed the <span class="highlight">oversampling_pipeline.sv</span> module to handle this clock domain crossing efficiently. Initially, the 16-bit multiplication and division operations caused resource bottlenecks. To address this, I implemented a <span class="highlight">pipelining strategy</span>, delaying the response by one clock cycle but significantly reducing resource usage. This optimization improved the DAC’s throughput and demonstrated my ability to balance trade-offs in real-time systems.

    <!-- Delta Sigma Modulation Section -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Delta Sigma Modulation</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        Another key contribution was implementing <span class="highlight">Delta Sigma Modulation</span> in the <span class="highlight">delta_sigma_single.sv</span> file. This module converted a 16-bit digital input into a high-frequency pulse density output of 1s and 0s, achieving an analog output (Thanks to our hardware team!) with precision down to 1/(2^16) between -3.3 and 3.3 volts. Mastering this complex signal processing technique required deep dives into modulation theory and SystemVerilog, showcasing my ability to learn and apply advanced concepts to meet stringent accuracy requirements.

        Note: Due to an NDA with Fieldline Medical, I cannot share the source code. However, I’m happy to discuss my approach and technical decisions in detail during an interview!

    <!-- Appended Kitchen Chaos Text Content -->
    <div class="project-description">
        Welcome to Kitchen Chaos, a fast-paced cooking simulation game built using the <span class="highlight">Unity engine</span> and hosted via WebGL on GitHub. This project is a direct implementation of a detailed tutorial by <span class="highlight">Code Monkey</span> on YouTube, undertaken to expand my software development skills and enhance my resume for a career in the field. Below, I outline key lessons learned during this process, showcasing my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies like Unity and <span class="highlight">C#</span>.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Mastering Game Development: Advanced Unity Engine and C# Proficiency</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        This project is not an original creation but a faithful execution of Code Monkey’s comprehensive Unity tutorial, designed to broaden my technical expertise. Through this experience, I gained practical proficiency with the <span class="highlight">Unity game engine</span>, mastering its scene management and component-based architecture to craft an interactive game environment. A significant achievement was implementing <span class="highlight">animations</span> using Unity’s Animator components and state machines, ensuring fluid character movements and responsive gameplay. Additionally, I explored <span class="highlight">C# delegates</span>, leveraging them to create modular event-handling systems that enhanced the game’s logic efficiency. This process demonstrated my ability to rapidly learn and apply complex tools, a vital skill for software development.
    </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        Beyond the technical aspects, completing Kitchen Chaos deepened my understanding of <span class="highlight">WebGL deployment</span>, as I successfully exported the game to run seamlessly on a GitHub-hosted site. Working with <span class="highlight">C#</span> also reinforced my grasp of object-oriented programming, particularly in managing game states and player interactions. By following this tutorial, I not only built a functional game but also showcased my capacity to absorb advanced concepts—like Unity’s physics engine and scripting API—in a short timeframe. This project underscores my commitment to continuous learning and adaptability, qualities I aim to bring to a professional software development role.
